            <h2>What is CSS..?</h2>
        <p  id="csspara">CSS stands for <em>"Cascading Style Sheet."</em> Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages.
           They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.
           CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document. 
           Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. 
           Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. 
           For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site. 
           If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text.

        <h2>Use of CSS...?</h2>
       <p id="usecss">
            Use of CSS is the recommended way of defining how HTML pages are displayed. You should use HTML to define the basic structure (using elements such as &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, etc.) and CSS to define how these elements should appear (e.g. heading should be in bold Arial font, paragraphs should be indented, etc.).

                This approach has several advantages:
                
                Maintenance:
                It is much easier to maintain the appearance of a Web site. If you use a single CSS file updating this file allows the Web site look-and-feel to be altered easily; in contrast use of HTML formatting elements would require every file to be updated to change the appearance.
                Functionality:
                CSS provides rich functionality, including defining the appearance of HTML pages when they are printed.
                Accessibility:
                Use of CSS provides much greater accessibility, allowing users with special needs to alter the appearance of a Web page to suit their requirements. CSS also allows Web pages to be more easily rendered by special devices, such as speaking browsers, PDAs, etc.
                There are disadvantages to use of CSS. In particular legacy browsers such as Netscape 4 have difficulty in processing CSS. However, since such legacy browsers are now in a minority the biggest barrier to deployment of CSS is probably a lack of understand or inertia.
