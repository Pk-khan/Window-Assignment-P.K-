        <h2>What is JS(Java script)...?</h2>
        <p id="jspara">
            JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content,
             control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
            (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on 
            web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, 
            interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.
             It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

        <h2>Use of JavaScript..?</h2>
         <p id="usejs">
            JavaScript is mainly used for web-based applications and web browsers. But JavaScript is also used beyond the Web in software, servers and embedded hardware controls. Here are some basic things JavaScript is used for:

 
            1.     Adding interactive behavior to web pages
            JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages. There are almost no limits to the things you can do with JavaScript on a web page – these are just a few examples:
            
            Show or hide more information with the click of a button
            
            Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers over it
            
            Slide through a carousel of images on the homepage
            
            Zooming in or zooming out on an image
            
            Displaying a timer or count-down on a website
            
            Playing audio and video in a web page
            
            Displaying animations
            
            Using a drop-down hamburger menu
            
            2.     Creating web and mobile apps
            Developers can use various JavaScript frameworks for developing and building web and mobile apps. JavaScript frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers with pre-written code to use for routine programming features and tasks—literally a framework to build websites or web applications around. 
            
            Popular JavaScript front-end frameworks include React, React Native, Angular, and Vue. Many companies use Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript V8 engine. A few famous examples include Paypal, LinkedIn, Netflix, and Uber!
            
            3.     Building web servers and developing server applications
            Beyond websites and apps, developers can also use JavaScript to build simple web servers and develop the back-end infrastructure using Node.js. 
            4.     Game development
            Of course, you can also use JavaScript to create browser games. These are a great way for beginning developers to practice their JavaScript skills.
