      <h2>What is HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language)?</h2>
       <p class="para">
         Html stands for <em><span style= "color:red">"Hypertext Markup Language."</span></em> HTML is the language used to create webpages. "Hypertext" refers to the hyperlinks that an HTML page may contain.<br> 
         "Markup language" refers to the way tags are used to define the page layout and elements within the page.<br>

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <br>
        HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br>
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img &gt;/ and &lt;input &gt;/ directly introduce content into the page.<br>

       <h2>Use of HTML...?</h2>
       <p id="usehtml">
         There are some use of html...<br>
        1. Web pages development
        HTML is heavily used for creating pages that are displayed on the world wide web. Every page contains a set of HTML tags including hyperlinks which are used for connecting to other pages. 
        Every page that we witness, on the world wide web, is written using a version of HTML code.<br>
        
        2. Web document Creation
        Document creation on the internet is dominated by HTML and its basic concept via tag and DOM i.e. document object model. HTML tags are inserted before and afterward or phrases to locate their format and location on the page. A web document consists of three sections: title, head, and body. Head includes the information to identify the document, including title and any other important keyword. 
        A title can be seen on the browser’s bar and the body section is the main portion of the website visible to the viewer. All three segments are designed and created by the uses of HTML tags. Every section has its own specific set of tags, which are dedicatedly rendered keeping the head, title and body concepts in a loop.<br>
        3. Cutting edge feature
        HTML5 with its set of standards and API is being used to introduce some of the latest trends in website creation business. Like polyfill libraries, which are supported by old browsers equally well. Browser like Google Chrome is the perfect choice when it comes to implementing an HTML5 latest set of standards and APIs. 
        There is a JavaScript library available called Modernizr, which can detect features that let the developer dynamically load polyfill libraries as required.<br>
        
        4. Responsive images on web pages
        At the elementary level in applications of HTML, queries can be set to utilize the images, which are responsive in nature. With the srcset attribute of img element in HTML, and combining it with picture elements, a developer can fully control how the user will render an image. 
        Now different types of an image with size variation can be loaded by using the img element. Rules can be easily set with the picture element, we can declare img element with default source and then for every case, a source can be provided.<br>
        
        5. Client-side storage
        Earlier, a user could not save the user’s browser data that would persist across sessions. To meet this requirement, server-side infrastructure has to be built or user’s cookies can be used. But with HTML5, client-side storage is feasible using localStorage and IndexDB. 
        These two strategies have their own standards and features. localStorage basically gives string-based hash-table storage. Its API is very simple and provides the developer with setItem, getItem, and removeItem methods. IndexDB, on the other hand, is a larger and better client-side data store. IndexDB database can be expanded with the user’s permission.
